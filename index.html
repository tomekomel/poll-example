The start of our Delivery Week means that new Meal Kits are available to be delivered in your Meal Box.\n\n#### 10.2 Rolling Basis of Meal Selection.\nYou have the option of selecting the day you would like to receive your Meal Box, and, if your specific subscription allows for Meal Kit selection, you also have the option of selecting the specific Meal Kits you would like to receive, on a weekly basis. The day you select to receive your first Meal Box will be the default. In subsequent weeks, if you do not make a change, your Meal Box will arrive on the day you initially selected every week (unless you pause your order, pursuant to this Agreement, or there are extenuating circumstances, detailed in this Agreement). If you choose to have your delivery on another day for a specific week, that day will become the default, and subsequent weeks will have your Meal Box arriving on the newly selected day.\n\nMeal Kit selection and delivery day selection is on a rolling basis, and all selections “lock” five days prior to the delivery day. For example, if your subscription allows for Meal Kit selection and you receive your Meal Box on Fridays, you will have to make your selection of Meal Kits you want included in your Meal Box on Sunday by 11:59 PM PST. Your credit card or other payment source will then be charged the following day. Similarly, if you want to change the delivery day, you will have to make your selection five days prior to your new delivery day. For example, if you normally receive your Meal Box on Thursdays, but want to receive your Meal Box on a Monday, you will have to make the change five days prior to Monday, which would be the Wednesday of the previous week.\n\nPlease note that the specific days in which a Meal Box can be delivered varies by geographic region, and delivery on each day will not be available in all areas. If you have any questions about your area and delivery, please contact Customer Care at (973) 210-4915 or use Live Chat on EveryPlate.com.\n\n#### 10.3 Deactivation Procedures. \nPlease note that the ability to change an order locks five days prior to your scheduled delivery date. Therefore, if you wish to deactivate your Account and/or cancel or change an order, you must do so before the day and time listed above for your respective delivery date. For example, if you have a scheduled delivery date on Tuesday, you have until Thursday at 11:59 PM PST to cancel your subscription. If you do so after the time listed for your delivery day, you will be charged and receive your Meal Box for that week, and the cancellation will take effect for the following Delivery Week.\n\nTo deactivate your Account, please call EveryPlate Customer Care at (973) 210-4915 use Live Chat on EveryPlate.com stating that you wish to terminate your account, along with your full name and registered email address. Where required, you may also deactivate your Account by accessing your Account on the EveryPlate website. \n\n#### 10.4 Pausing your Order.\nDuring any production week, you have the option of pausing your deliveries. In order to do so, log on to your account page on the Site or App, select a particular week (by clicking on the delivery day highlighted) and then click on the “Pause Week” button. You will not be charged for any week in which your order is paused. Please note that this action cannot be taken for any scheduled order which has already “Locked,” pursuant to Section 10.2. Additionally, pausing an order shall only apply to the week in which you pause, and automatic deliveries will commence the following week, unless you choose to pause the following week, subject to the details, above.\n\n#### 10.5 Delivery Specifics. \nIn the case of weather which inhibits the ability to make safe deliveries, or other events beyond our control that interfere with our ability to deliver your order, we will attempt to deliver your Order as soon as reasonably possible. In some cases, delivery may occur on a date other than your scheduled delivery day. If the delivery of your Meal Box is not feasible, we will cancel your delivery for the period so affected and issue you a credit, as determined in our sole discretion or refund of a part or the whole of the purchase price for that Meal Box.\n\n\n### 11. FORCE MAJEURE\n\nWe will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay the performance of, any of our obligations that is caused by events outside our reasonable control (“Force Majeure Event”). A Force Majeure Event includes any act, event, non-happening, omission or accident beyond our reasonable control and includes, but is not limited, to the following: (1) Strikes, lock-outs, or other industrial action; (2) Civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist attack or threat of terrorist attack, war, or threat or preparation for war; (3) Fire, explosion, storm, flood, earthquake, subsidence, epidemic, or other natural disaster; (4) Impossibility of the use of railways, shipping, aircraft, motor transport, or other means of public or private transport; (5) Impossibility of the use of public or private telecommunications networks; and (6) The acts, decrees, legislation, regulations, or restrictions of any government.\n\nOur performance under this Agreement is deemed to be suspended for the period that the Force Majeure Event continues, and we will have an extension of time for performance for the duration of that period. We will use our reasonable efforts to bring the Force Majeure Event to a close or to find a solution by which our obligations under this Agreement may be performed despite the Force Majeure Event.\n\n\n### 12. RECEIPT OF THE MATERIALS AND FOOD PREPARATION\n\nEveryPlate uses specific materials to refrigerate perishable items and also uses third party delivery companies to deliver Meal Boxes to customers. Please note that you are responsible for reviewing the Meal Box upon delivery and inspecting all of the Products contained within for any defects or other problems upon delivery. If you are not home when your Meal Box is delivered, the Meal Box will be left at your door or in a common area. Upon the completion of your review of the Meal Box, we recommend that you place all perishables in your refrigerator to ensure the ingredients’ integrity. The risk of loss and/or damage passes to you at the time of delivery. We highly recommend that you review the USDA’s instructions on safe food handling, which can be found here. All items are solely at your risk from the time of delivery. As such, you acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for any preparatory steps, storage of the contents of any Meal Kits, safe washing (we recommend that all fresh produce is washed prior to inclusion in any meal), and the cooking of all the ingredients of the respective Meal Kits. We recommend that you use a thermometer to measure the temperature of any poultry, fish, or meat products that arrive in the insulated portion of the Meal Box, and, pursuant to USDA Guidelines (found here), you should utilize said thermometer to ensure that they are at (or below) 41 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nEveryPlate recommends that all cooking instructions found in the recipe booklet be followed, and all seafood, meats, and poultry should be cooked to the USDA’s recommended internal temperatures (165 degrees Fahrenheit for poultry; 160 degrees Fahrenheit for ground meats; 145 degrees for whole meats; and 145 degrees Fahrenheit for seafood). EveryPlate recommends utilizing a food thermometer to verify internal temperatures. For more information, please see the USDA’s website, found here).\n\n\n### 13. RECIPE CARDS\n\nAdditionally, please note that each Meal Kit will have a corresponding recipe card contained in the Meal Box. If your Meal Box does not contain one or more of the corresponding recipe cards, you can refer to the Site and App for the week’s recipes. If you have any questions or concerns related to the recipe cards, please use Live Chat on EveryPlate.com or call Customer Care at (973) 210-4915.\n\n\n### 14.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION \u0026 BINDING ARBITRATION\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT IN THIS SECTION (“ARBITRATION AGREEMENT”) CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH EVERYPLATE AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM US.\n\n#### 24.1 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. \nYou agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating in any way to your access or use of the Site or the App, to any products sold or distributed through the Site or the App, or to any aspect of your relationship with EveryPlate, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims or seek relief in small claims court if your claims qualify; and (2) you or EveryPlate may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).  This Arbitration Agreement shall apply, without limitation, to all disputes or claims and requests for relief that arose or were asserted before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version of this Agreement.  \n\n#### 24.2 Arbitration Rules and Forum.\nThe Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement.  To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your dispute or claim or request for relief to: EveryPlate, c/o Legal Department, 28 Liberty Street, 10th Floor, New York, NY 10005.  The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider.  Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or request for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/.  JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267.  If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum.  If the arbitrator finds that you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a waiver from JAMS, EveryPlate will pay them for you.  In addition, EveryPlate will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for disputes, claims, or requests for relief totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. \n \nYou may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another mutually agreed location.   Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. \n\n#### 24.3 Authority of Arbitrator.\nThe arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to (a) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement and (b) resolve any dispute related to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to, any assertion that all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable.  The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and EveryPlate.  The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or joined with any other cases or parties.  The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award monetary damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law, the arbitral forum’s rules, and the Agreement (including the Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.  The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have.  The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us.  \n\n#### 24.4 Waiver of Jury Trial. \nYOU AND EVERYPLATE HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY.  You and EveryPlate are instead electing that all disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in Section 21.1 above.  An arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court and must follow this Agreement as a court would.  However, there is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review.  \n\n#### 24.5 Waiver of Class or Other Non-Individualized Relief.  \nALL DISPUTES, CLAIMS, AND REQUESTS FOR RELIEF WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER.  If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any of this subsection’s limitations as to a given dispute, claim, or request for relief, then such aspect must be severed from the arbitration and brought into the State or Federal Courts located in the State of New York.  All other disputes, claims, or requests for relief shall be arbitrated.  \n\n#### 24.6 30-Day Right to Opt Out. \nYou have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to: us-legal@hellofresh.com, within 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.   Your notice must include your name and address, your EveryPlate username (if any), the email address you used to set up your EveryPlate account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement.    If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you.  Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us.\n\n#### 24.7 Severability. \nExcept as provided in subsection 24.5, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.\n\n#### 24.8 Survival of Agreement.\nThis Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with EveryPlate.\n\n#### 24.9 Modification. \nNotwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if EveryPlate makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject that change within thirty (30) days of such change becoming effective by writing EveryPlate at the following address: EveryPlate, c/o Legal Department, 28 Liberty Street 10th  Floor, New York, NY 10005. \n\n\n### 25. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE\n\nTHIS AGREEMENT AND ANY ACTION RELATED THERETO WILL BE GOVERNED AND INTERPRETED BY AND UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, CONSISTENT WITH THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY PRINCIPLES THAT PROVIDE FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION.  THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON CONTRACTS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS DOES NOT APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT.\n\n\n### 26. TERM, TERMINATION AND SURVIVAL\n\n#### 26.1 Term.\nThe Agreement commences on the date when you accept them (as described in the preamble above) and remain in full force and effect while you use the Offerings, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the Agreement.\n\n#### 26.2 Prior Use. \nNotwithstanding the foregoing, you hereby acknowledge and agree that the Agreement commenced on the earlier to occur of (a) the date you first used the Offerings or (b) the date you accepted the Agreement and will remain in full force and effect while you use any Offerings, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the Agreement.\n\n#### 26.3 Termination.\nNotwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement, we reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate or suspend your right to access or use the Site and to order, receive and use the Products, at any time and for any or no reason, including, without limitation, any violation of this Agreement. You can cancel your Service in accordance to the terms set forth in Sections 6 and 10.3 hereunder.  Except as set forth above, the Service subscription fee shall be non-refundable. If timely payment cannot be charged to your payment provider for any reason, if you have materially breached any provision of the Agreement, or if EveryPlate is required to do so by law (e.g., where the provision of the Site, the App or the Services is, or becomes, unlawful), Company has the right to, immediately and without notice, suspend or terminate any services provided to you. You agree that all terminations for cause shall be made in EveryPlate’s sole discretion and that EveryPlate shall not be liable to you or any third party for any termination of your Account. We reserve the right to change any and all Content and to modify, suspend or stop providing access to the Site (or any features or functionality of the Site) and the Products at any time without notice and without obligation or liability to you.\n\n#### 26.4 Effect of Termination. \nTermination of any Service includes removal of access to such Service and barring of further use of the Service.  Termination of all Service also includes deletion of your password and all related information, files and Content associated with or inside your Account (or any part thereof).  Upon termination of any Service, your right to use such Service will automatically terminate immediately. You understand that any termination of Service may involve deletion of Your Content associated therewith from our live databases.  EveryPlate will not have any liability whatsoever to you for any suspension or termination.  All provisions of the Agreement which by their nature should survive, shall survive termination of the Offering or Service, including without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of liability.\n\n#### 26.5 No Subsequent Registration.\nIf your registration(s) with or ability to access the Service is discontinued by EveryPlate due to your violation of any portion of the Agreement, then you agree that you shall not attempt to re-register with or access the Service through use of a different member name or otherwise, and you acknowledge that you will not be entitled to receive a refund for fees related to those Services to which your access has been terminated.  In the event that you violate the immediately preceding sentence, EveryPlate reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to immediately take any or all of the actions set forth herein without any notice or warning to you.\n\n### 27. SEVERABILITY AND WAIVER\n\nIf any of this Agreement are determined by any competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, such term, condition or provision will to that extent be severed from the remaining terms, conditions, and provisions which will continue to be valid to the fullest extent permitted by law.\n\nNo waiver by EveryPlate of any provision in this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or a waiver of any other provision, and any failure to assert a right or provision under this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.\n\n\n#### 28.

For purposes of this section, **“Personal Information”** has the meaning given in the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (**“CCPA”**) but does not include information exempted from the scope of the CCPA.  \n\n**Your California privacy rights.** As a California resident, you have the rights listed below.

Our use of some of these services may be classified under California law as a “sale” of your Personal Information to the companies that provide the services because they collect information from our users (e.g., device data and online activity data) to help them serve ads more likely to interest you.    You can request to opt-out out of this “sale” of your personal information here: [**Do Not Sell My Personal Information.**](/ccpa)\n\nWe reserve the right to confirm your California residency to process your requests and will need to confirm your identity to process your requests to exercise your information, access or deletion rights.

In order to designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf, you must provide a valid power of attorney, the requester’s valid government-issued identification, and the authorized agent’s valid government issued identification.
